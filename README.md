## ðŸ“Œ Project Summary  
Promotional campaigns (Discounts, BOGO offers) donâ€™t affect every customer the same way.  
This project looks at Heterogeneous Treatment Effects (HTE) to understand *which groups of customers benefit most (or least) from promotions.  

We used a Kaggle dataset with 64,000 customer records to test two approaches:  
1. Interaction Analysis â€“ check how offers work for different groups (past behavior, referral, location, channel, engagement).  
2. Risk-Based Stratification â€“ divide customers into 4 risk groups (based on natural chance of conversion) and test effectiveness.
